    <h4>Say goodbye to administration costs</h4>
    <p>Many business management tools take your money, then send you on your own, advising you to hire your own administrator (for an additional cost, obviously) as well as brave their documentation in order to figure out how to just get started using the platform. We don’t have this philosophy. We provide administration services from setup to continuous support, from occasional to frequent changes, depending on your level of need.</p>
    <h4>Automation</h4>
    <img class="image" src="../assets/Tools Panel.png" width="454" height="920" alt=""/>
    <p>Have an action you know you’ll need to do multiple times? The simple answer is to automate that. Whether it’s a communication email, billing reminder, newsletter, update, or just a periodic check in, we can create shortcuts that turn lengthy, monotonous tasks into something similar that requires only a few clicks.</p>
    <h4>Marketing</h4>
    <p>Keep track of all of your communications, in one place. When was the last time you called a customer or a prospect? The last email you sent? Who on your list doesn’t want to be emailed? What are your email open rates? Our simple analytics tools provide those answers and much more instantly.</p>
    <h4>Contacts</h4>

    <p>All your customers, all of your leads, in one spot. Keep data on their status, budget, timeline, needs, questions, birthdays, or even their kid’s favorite ice cream.</p>
    <h4>Calendar</h4>

    <p>Scheduling, sharing calendar events, and keeping your week organized is one of the biggest issues most companies struggle with. Our Calendar application is set up to streamline all sharing issues, keep you connected to all of your tasks, and keep your team on a common schedule.</p>
    <h4>Storage</h4>
    <p>Photos, graphics, documents, PDFs—so many customers have a need for a simple, centralized way to store all of their business documents. Many companies force you to signup for a secondary service, then go through said service's dashboard--another tool to learn, another expense, and another moving part to support. We provide a simple, intuitive interface, ensuring that you only have one place to visit and navigate for all of your storage needs.</p>
    <h4>Privacy</h4>
    <p>
      Above all else, we respect your data privacy. Some companies try to spell out extensive limitations on what you can or can’t do with your information, or even try to put clauses in about reselling or restricting your data. We don’t believe in any of those notions. We are champions of the “your data, your rules” way of thinking. We will never try to restrict your usage, and if you ever decide to leave our platform, we provide easy access to your data to allow you to transfer away.
